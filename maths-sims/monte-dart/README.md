# Monte Carlo Dart Simulation ðŸŽ¯

A simple, visual simulation of the **Monte Carlo method** to estimate the value of Ï€ (pi), using **C++** and **raylib**. Darts are randomly "thrown" into a square board, and the ratio of darts that land inside the circle vs the total is used to approximate Ï€.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Uses the **Monte Carlo method** to approximate Ï€
- Real-time graphical output using **raylib**
- Darts are drawn incrementally â€” watch Ï€ converge visually!
- Colored dart hits: ðŸŸ¢ = inside circle, ðŸ”´ = outside
- Progress bar, Ï€ estimate, error display
- Rendered using a persistent render texture for performance and visual clarity

## ðŸ§  How it works

1. A circle is inscribed inside a square.
2. Random "dart" coordinates are generated within the square.
3. If the dart falls inside the circle, it's a "hit".
4. The ratio of hits to total darts approximates Ï€:
