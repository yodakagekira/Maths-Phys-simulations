# 🧮 MATHS & PHYSICS SIMULATIONS (C++)

**Interactive real-time simulations built in C++ using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)**  
A growing collection of mathematical and physics-based experiments, visualized through code.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository transforms abstract equations and probabilistic models into real-time, interactive visual simulations using C++ and the `raylib` graphics library.

Projects range from educational demos to complex simulations involving randomness, dynamics, and emergent behavior.

**Designed for:**
- Building visual intuition  
- Exploring systems-level thinking  
- Clean, low-overhead C++ code  
- Experimentation and learning by doing

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Requirements

| Component     | Details                              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Language**  | C++                                   |
| **Graphics**  | raylib (2D / 3D rendering + input)    |
| **Build**     | Makefiles or direct compiler commands |
| **Platforms** | Linux, Windows (MinGW / MSYS2), macOS |

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each simulation folder typically contains:
- One or more `.cpp` source files  
- A `Makefile` or build instructions  
- (Optional) Pre-built executable  
- Inline comments explaining the simulation or model

**Notes:**
- On Windows, use **MinGW/MSYS2** or another GCC-compatible toolchain  
- Some projects may use direct `g++` commands instead of Makefiles

## 🎮 Controls

Controls vary by simulation and may include:
- 🖱️ Mouse interaction  
- ⌨️ Keyboard toggles for parameters  
- 🧭 Camera movement (for 3D scenes)

> 📌 Refer to on-screen instructions or source code comments in each simulation for details.
